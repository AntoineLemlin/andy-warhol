        Whatever you feel, think, or say about Andy Warhol, it’s probably true,
        and he would likely agree with you. There is already so much written
        about him, and yet the story seems to have no end.

          The youngest child of three, Andy was born on August 6, 1928, in the
          working-class neighborhood of Oakland, in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.
          Stricken at an early age with a rare neurological disorder, the young
          Andy Warhol found solace and escape in the form of popular celebrity
          magazines and DC comic books, imagery he would return to years later.
          Warhol was actually born as Andy Warhola, but dropped the “a” later in
          life.
